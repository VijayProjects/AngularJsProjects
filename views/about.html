<blockquote>
    The device manufacturer or installer warrants that properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. If you obtain updates or supplements directly from Microsoft during the 90-day term of this limited warranty, Microsoft provides this limited warranty for them. This limited warranty does not cover problems that you cause, that arise when you fail to follow instructions, or that are caused by events beyond the reasonable control of the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft. The limited warranty starts when the first user acquires the software and lasts for 90 days. Any supplements, updates, or replacement software that you may receive from the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft, during that 90-day period are also covered, but only for the remainder of that 90-day period or for 30 days, whichever is longer. Transferring the software will not extend the limited warranty.
